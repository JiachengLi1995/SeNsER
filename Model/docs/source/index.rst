- **Inference**:

  - `LightNER <https://github.com/LiyuanLucasLiu/LightNER>`_: inference w. models pre-trained / trained w. *any* following tools, *efficiently*. 

- **Training**:

  - `LD-Net <https://github.com/LiyuanLucasLiu/LD-Net>`_: train NER models w. efficient contextualized representations.
  - `VanillaNER <https://github.com/LiyuanLucasLiu/Vanilla_NER>`_: train vanilla NER models w. pre-trained embedding.

- **Distant Training**:

  - `AutoNER <https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/AutoNER/>`_: train NER models w.o. line-by-line annotations and get competitive performance.

--------------------------

This project provides high-performance character-aware sequence labeling tools, including [Training](#usage), [Evaluation](#evaluation) and [Prediction](#prediction). 

Details about LM-LSTM-CRF can be accessed `here <http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04109>`_, and the implementation is based on the PyTorch library.
